These input files are designed to test the functionality of shadows in the ray tracer.

In every scene, the eye is located at (0, 0, 20), facing in the negative direction along the z-axis, with the up direction along the y-axis.
A yellow sphere of radius 4 is located at (0, 0, 0), and an orange sphere of radius 1 is located at (2, 2, 10).

The only variation between scenes is the single light attribute:
1. directionallight_shadow_test1.txt contains a white directional light oriented along the vector (-1, -1, -5)
4. pointlight_shadow_test1.txt contains a white point light located at the point (4, 4, 20)
5. pointlight_shadow_test2.txt contains a white point light located at the point (6, 6, 30)
6. pointlight_shadow_test3.txt contains a white point light located at the point (8, 8, 40)

The object of these tests is to demonstrate how shadows are cast by directional and point lights.

In all examples, the orange sphere casts a shadow on the yellow sphere.

The directional light example shows the shadow cast when the light source is at infinite distance from the spheres.

The point light examples show the shadow cast when the light source is at various distances from the spheres.
As the point light moves farther away from the spheres the shadow becomes smaller and closer in appearance to the shadow cast by a directional light.
